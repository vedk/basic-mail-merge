Subject: Request to work on a project | Web and Coding Club, IIT Bombay

Respected Professor %s,


I hope this email finds you in the best of health. I am Ved Khandekar, a convener at the Web and Coding Club (WnCC) of IIT Bombay. The club has been catering to the programming interests of students for 15 years. We have 45+ open-source repositories, our own open-sourced WnCC Wikipedia - Grundy which has 100+ articles. We try to help students experience and explore different domains of CS so that they can discover what excites them the most and pursue a career in the same.


I am writing this email to inform you about our initiative Hello-FOSS. Hello-FOSS is an annual event conducted by WnCC as part of the Hacktoberfest to encourage and instil the Open Source development culture in the institute, helping 10,000+ IITB students in making their first contributions and work on a real-life project. 


I was particularly very fascinated by your work in the field of %s. I feel these areas are not highly explored by a majority of the undergraduate students of our institute, a lot of the students can get to learn and benefit under your guidance.


Therefore, I kindly request you to contribute and add any project which you would like to make open source, and feel can also help the students get a deeper insight into the above mentioned field.


This year we have the theme of "Social Good" and we wish to include projects with a social cause linked to them; or projects which, in some way can be used to help others and bring a positive change in our society.


If you have further queries regarding Hello-FOSS or WnCC in general, I would be more than happy to attend to your questions. 


Regards,


Ved Mangesh Khandekar
